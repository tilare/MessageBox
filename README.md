# MessageBox
Modern Messenger-style addon to handle your whispers

 **Whisper History –** Stores and displays your past whisper conversations.

 **Popup Notifications –** Get alerts when a new whisper arrives. The minimap button also has a red notification badge that displays the unread message count.

 **Contact List –** View all your contacts in one place, complete with a search bar and unread message counts.

 **Send Direct Whispers –** Message players straight from the addon's window, now with optional cascading popout windows, similar to WIM.

 **Intercept Whispers -** Let MessageBox intercept whisper commands in UI or chat, opening up to who you were trying to whisper. 

 **Modern and Classic Themes -** Toggle the Classic theme for a more Blizzard-style UI.

 **Background Who Queue -** Toggle to enable a /who lookup on a 30 second cooldown that runs in the background to fill out information for your contacts that you do not have added as a friend.

 **Right Click Context Menu -** Right click on contacts to show options to Invite, Target, Add Friend, Ignore, Delete, Pin, and Pop Out Conversation.

 **Color Picker -** Customize your UI with a color picker. 

 **Linking Support -** Supports item linking and web links.

 **Pin System -** Pin a conversation to prevent it from being deleted.

 **Conversation Management –** Delete individual chats or clear your entire history at once.

 

 **Commands -** Open the UI with /messagebox, /mbox, or /mb.
